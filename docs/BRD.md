1. Project Overview

1.1 Project Name:

Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Statistical Modeling

1.2 Project Description:

This project aims to develop a statistical model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using synthetic transaction data, we will apply machine learning and statistical techniques to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The final model should be accurate, efficient, and capable of handling class imbalances.

2. Business Objectives

2.1 Goals:

Build a model that accurately detects fraudulent transactions.
Reduce the number of false positives while maintaining high fraud detection rates.
Provide a structured approach for financial institutions to integrate the model into their fraud prevention systems.
Ensure model interpretability for decision-making.

2.2 Success Metrics:

Model Accuracy: > 95%
Precision: > 90% (to minimize false positives)
Recall (Sensitivity): > 90% (to detect fraudulent transactions effectively)
F1-score: Balance between precision and recall
Execution Speed: Model should process transactions in real-time or near real-time

3. Scope

3.1 In-Scope:

Dataset Selection: Kaggleâ€™s Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature selection, and handling class imbalance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding transaction patterns and fraud trends
Statistical Model Development: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and advanced techniques such as Gradient Boosting
Performance Evaluation: Using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics
Implementation & Integration: Preparing the model for deployment in real-world applications

3.2 Out-of-Scope:

Deployment in production systems
Live transaction monitoring
Fraud prevention policy recommendations

4. Stakeholders

4.1 Primary Stakeholders:

Data Scientists: Responsible for model development and evaluation.

5.2 Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: Model should classify transactions in milliseconds.
Scalability: Model should be able to process large datasets.
Security: Ensure data is anonymized and secure.
Interpretability: Model decisions should be explainable.

6. Data Requirements
